// If we have to search a block of code in given input 
//we can do throught nested loop 
// for example we have given string S = abceabcdabceabcd
// we have to find P = abcd in S
// We can apply nested loop 
//but make sure whoever loop will be inside the outer 
// will compare character like if i+j== j value we foound our character if any character 
// does not match with any Character of P inner loop will break 
// after that we will check whetther our loop
